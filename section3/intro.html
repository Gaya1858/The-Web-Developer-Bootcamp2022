                The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated
                descendant of
                the wolf, and is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, <b>extinct
                    wolf</b>,[6][7] and
                the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
                domesticated,[9][8]
                by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their
                long
                association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the
                ability
                to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
                physical
                attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans,
                such as
                hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy,
                and
                aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
                human-canine
                bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the
                sobriquet of
                "man's best friend".[14]

                Taxonomy
            </h2>
            <p>
                In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word
                naming
                of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[15] and under this genus, he
                listed
                the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris
                and, on
                the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate
                species
                from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other
                canid.[16]

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years ago and brought an end to the
                dinosaurs and
                the appearance of the first carnivorans.[20] The name carnivoran is given to a member of the order
                Carnivora.
                Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth called carnassials, in which the first lower molar and
                the
                last upper premolar possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting
                meat. This
                dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past 60 million years for diets composed of
                meat,
                for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions,
                and
                walruses. Today, not all carnivorans are carnivores, such as the insect-eating Aardwolf.[5]
