    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>

        <p>"Cuttles" redirects here. For the card game, see Cuttle.</p>
        <p><b>Cuttlefish or cuttles<sup>[2]</sup></b> are marine molluscs of the order <b>Sepiida</b>. They belong to
            the class Cephalopoda,
            which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
            cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
            Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers,
            with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
            largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
        </p>
        <h2>First Paragraph</h2>
        <p>Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
            include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
            cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
            invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]
        </p>
        <h2>Second Paragraph</h2>
        <p>The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
            the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the
            cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed.
            The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.</p>
